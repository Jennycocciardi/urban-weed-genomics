These analyses are meant to compare a country-wide catalog of SNPs to a city-wide created catalog of SNPs. In other words, a national vs. local comparison for the catalog. The idea is that if constructing a city catalog gives us better resolution within city, maybe we should take that approach instead of using the national or "global" catalog of SNPs that we made.

This folder contains Ava's tests for *Poa annua* (PA) in Baltimore, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. The same subset of catalog samples were used within city as were used to create the global catalog, so perhaps this is the wrong approach. Probably better to use all samples available if creating a within-city catalog.
