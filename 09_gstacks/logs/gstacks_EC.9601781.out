Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 84627 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  662 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (0.8%);
  For the remaining 83965 loci (99.2%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 331.9 bp;
  6148 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (7.3%)
    Mean overlap: 23.6bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 316.6;
  Out of 34666224 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 407.5 reads per locus),
    34216196 were successfuly aligned (98.7%);
  Mean insert length was 377.1, stdev: 114.0 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 83965 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=39.8x, stdev=10.7x, min=20.5x, max=73.9x
  mean number of sites per locus: 322.8
  a consistent phasing was found for 30145 of out 55524 (54.3%) diploid loci needing phasing

gstacks is done.
