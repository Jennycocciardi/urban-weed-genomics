Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 121227 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  905 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (0.7%);
  For the remaining 120322 loci (99.3%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 308.0 bp;
  2869 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (2.4%)
    Mean overlap: 15.2bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 276.9;
  Out of 36220210 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 298.0 reads per locus),
    35856088 were successfuly aligned (99.0%);
  Mean insert length was 293.3, stdev: 67.6 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 120322 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=43.9x, stdev=9.6x, min=27.3x, max=77.3x
  mean number of sites per locus: 298.3
  a consistent phasing was found for 26231 of out 57046 (46.0%) diploid loci needing phasing

gstacks is done.
