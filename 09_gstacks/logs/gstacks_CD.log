Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 308508 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  1812 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (0.6%);
  For the remaining 306696 loci (99.4%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 305.7 bp;
  15307 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (5.0%)
    Mean overlap: 21.7bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 260.4;
  Out of 149547992 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 480.8 reads per locus),
    147461343 were successfuly aligned (98.6%);
  Mean insert length was 302.7, stdev: 82.3 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 306696 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=52.2x, stdev=12.5x, min=29.9x, max=96.0x
  mean number of sites per locus: 296.3
  a consistent phasing was found for 172679 of out 336488 (51.3%) diploid loci needing phasing
