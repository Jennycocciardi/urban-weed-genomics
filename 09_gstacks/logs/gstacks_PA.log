Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 434136 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  3597 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (0.8%);
  For the remaining 430539 loci (99.2%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 303.9 bp;
  6939 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (1.6%)
    Mean overlap: 11.6bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 287.2;
  Out of 155356810 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 356.4 reads per locus),
    153445040 were successfuly aligned (98.8%);
  Mean insert length was 315.7, stdev: 85.6 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 430539 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=53.1x, stdev=15.2x, min=28.0x, max=94.7x
  mean number of sites per locus: 294.1
  a consistent phasing was found for 144263 of out 282441 (51.1%) diploid loci needing phasing

gstacks is done.
