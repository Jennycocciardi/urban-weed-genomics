Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 191323 loci:
  1 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  1080 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (0.6%);
  For the remaining 190242 loci (99.4%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 307.8 bp;
  3714 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (2.0%)
    Mean overlap: 12.7bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 283.5;
  Out of 130825208 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 681.8 reads per locus),
    129701531 were successfuly aligned (99.1%);
  Mean insert length was 298.3, stdev: 63.6 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 190243 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=48.6x, stdev=11.3x, min=28.6x, max=87.7x
  mean number of sites per locus: 298.1
  a consistent phasing was found for 89979 of out 176590 (51.0%) diploid loci needing phasing

gstacks is done.
