Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 112156 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  1019 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (0.9%);
  For the remaining 111137 loci (99.1%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 308.2 bp;
  3737 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (3.4%)
    Mean overlap: 18.7bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 302.2;
  Out of 50107576 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 442.5 reads per locus),
    49174293 were successfuly aligned (98.1%);
  Mean insert length was 376.5, stdev: 105.8 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 111137 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=47.8x, stdev=8.8x, min=29.2x, max=84.3x
  mean number of sites per locus: 298.6
  a consistent phasing was found for 79650 of out 199605 (39.9%) diploid loci needing phasing

gstacks is done.
